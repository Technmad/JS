      };

      const walkPeriod = new Period(2, 30);
      walkPeriod.format(); // => 'undefined hours and undefined minutes'

      //----------------------------
      //       Since format is an arrow function and is defined in the global context (topmost scope), it has this as window object.

      // Even if format is executed as a method on an object walkPeriod.format(), window is kept as the context of invocation. It happens because the arrow function has a static context that doesn't change on different invocation types.

      // The method returns 'undefined hours and undefined minutes', which is not the expected result.

      // 👍 The function expression solves the problem because a regular function does change its context depending on invocation:

      function Period(hours, minutes) {
        this.hours = hours;
        this.minutes = minutes;
      }

      Period.prototype.format = function () {
        console.log(this === walkPeriod); // => true
        return this.hours + " hours and " + this.minutes + " minutes";
      };

      const walkPeriod2 = new Period(2, 30);
      walkPeriod2.format(); // => '2 hours and 30 minutes'
